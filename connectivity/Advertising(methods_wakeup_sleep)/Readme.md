# DA1453x and DA1458x - Changing advertising methods using GPIO button interrupt or timer callbacks

## Example description

This example shows how to:
- Use a button to switch between advertising methods.
- Sleep or wake up after pressing a button for 3 seconds.
- Use timer callbacks to switch between advertising methods. 
- Use timer callbacks to go to sleep or wake up.

The expected result of the example can be verified by:
- Connecting a serial terminal on the work station to the MB (Mother Board) using UART.
- The status of the LED.

- Devices naming:
    - DA1453x is refering to DA14531-00, DA14531-01, DA14530 and DA14535.
    - DA1458x is refering to DA14585 and DA14586.
    - The DA14531-00 is the main DA14531 device. The -00 is just a new naming to introduce the variant DA14531-01. The DA14531-01 is a ROM variant of the main DA14531-00.
    - The DA14535 is a DA14531 upgrade.
	- The DA14533 is optimized for automotive and industrial applications at higher temperatures, and it is rated as operating up to 105 ºC and compliant with the AEC-Q100 (Grade 2) standard.

## Software Configuration
- Download the [SDK6 latest version](https://www.renesas.com/sdk6_latest)
- Install SEGGER’s J-Link tools.
- If using e² studio with LLVM instead of Keil, ensure your project settings are adjusted accordingly (instructions below).

Keil5.
__SEGGER’s J-Link__ tools should be downloaded and installed.
Serial Terminal software. For example Tera Term or PuTTY.

If using e² studio with LLVM instead of Keil, ensure your project settings are adjusted accordingly (instructions below).

## Using e² studio with LLVM
Setup for e² studio

#. Switching to e² studio: Instead of using Keil, you can use e² studio with LLVM as the compiler toolchain. Make sure your project is configured for LLVM by selecting the appropriate toolchain in e² studio.

#. Compile and Build: Open your project in e² studio and compile using LLVM. Ensure your environment variables and paths are properly set for the Renesas toolchain.

#. Run and Debug: Connect your device, set the proper debug configuration in e² studio, and start debugging using J-Link.


By switching to e² studio and LLVM, you can take advantage of advanced debugging tools and an open-source toolchain, while maintaining full compatibility with Renesas DA145xx devices.

For detailed steps on using e² studio, refer to the Renesas e² studio User Guide available on the [Renesas website](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/e2_studio_sdk6_getting_started/index.html).

## How to run the example

### Setup

For the initial setup of the project that involves linking the SDK to this SW example, please follow the Readme [here](../../Readme.md).

1. Start Keil using the `changing_advertising.uvprojx` Keil project file.

2. Expand the dialog shown in the red box in the image below.

   ![Expand_Select_Device](assets/Expand_Select_Device.png)

3. Select your device: DA14531, DA14586 or DA14585.
		
   ![Select_Device](assets/Select_Device.png)

4. Open a serial terminal on the work station using for example Tera Term/PuTTY with the following parameters:
	```
	- baud rate: 115200
	- data: 8 bits
	- stop: 1 bit
	- parity: None
	- flow  control: none
	```

5. Compile (F7) and launch (ctrl + F5) the example.\


## GPIO identification 
Make sure to read the correct identification according to your mother board and daughter board.

### DA14585/DA14586 GPIO identification with DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard
1. Identify LED:
	- The LED controlled in this example is `D5` and the color is `orange`.
2. Identify button:
	- `SW3` is used as button in this example

### DA1453x GPIO identification with DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard
1. Identify LED:
	- The LED controlled in this example is `D5` and the color is `orange`.
2. Identify button:
	- `SW2` is used as button in this example

### DA14585/DA14586 GPIO identification with Basic Dev Kit
1. Identify LED:
	- The LED controlled in this example is `USR` and the color is `green`.
2. Identify button:
	- The button connected (by the user) to P1_1 on J4

## Expected Results button example
- The changing advertising example is now running. 
- Make sure that the ADV_EXAMPLE and the ADV_BUTTON_EXAMPLE are both defined defined in _user_config.h_.
- Make sure *CFG_PRINTF*  is defined if UART messages are desired.
- The LED status is toggle when the advertising is started. The LED state will toggle between advertising changes and will remain off during permanent sleep periods. 
- The image below describes the behavior.

![adv_button_diagram](assets/adv_button_diagram.png)

## Expected Results timer example
- The changing advertising example is now running.
- Make sure ADV_EXAMPLE is defined in _user_config.h_ (if only the ADV_EXAMPLE definition is enabled the demo will change the advertising state via timer).
- Make sure that ADV_BUTTON_EXAMPLE is __not__ defined.
- Make sure *CFG_PRINTF*  is defined if UART messages are desired.
- The LED status is toggle when the advertising is started. The LED is set inactive when the system is going to sleep. 
- The image below describes the behavior.

![adv_timer_diagram](assets/adv_timer_diagram.png)

## Optional software configurations

 - The following parameters can be configured in _user_barebone.h_
 	- Set *UNDIRECT_ADV_INTERVAL* to the desired value in milliseconds to configure the undirected advertising interval.
 	- Set *NONCONN_ADV_INTERVAL* to the desired value in milliseconds to configure the non-connectible advertising interval.
 	- Set *UNDIRECT_ADV_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the duration of the undirected advertising in the timer based example.
 	- Set *NONCONN_ADV_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the duration of the non-connectible advertising in the timer based example.
 	- Set *SLEEP_DURATION* to the desired value multiplied by 10 milliseconds to determine the sleep duration in the timer based example.

## About this example
Starting point for this example is the BLE barebone project from SDK6. This provides the right framework for the advertising events used in this example.

- Comparing to BLE barebone project from SDK6 some changes were made to _user_barebone.c_, these changes can be easily traced as they are marked with the ADV_EXAMPLE flag.
- Minor changes were made to the _user_peripheral_setup_ files to accommodate the button functionality and LED indication.
- The user_callback_config.h has been slightly modified. Callback is added for non-connectible advertising.
- The user_button.h and user_button.c were added. These files accommodate the button functionality used in this example.


## Note
This example can be built by e2studio and LLVM compiler instead of using Keil.
