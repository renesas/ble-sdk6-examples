# DA1453x and DA1458x ibeacon

## Example description

Simple example showing how to implement an iBeacon on the DA1453x, DA1458x. All beacon payload
parameters (advertising interval, UUID etc.) are easily configurable from within the user
application (user_app.c).

The example is configured to use a random static Bluetooth Device address (BD address). This 
is generated upon power on or reset and will remain static throughout the life of the device. 
It is also guaranteed to be unique on each DA1453x or DA14585/586 device (i.e. a different BD address will be 
generated on each DA1453x or DA14585/586 on which this is example is run).

By default the output power is set to 0dBm. This can be increased to +2.5dBm (only for the DA1453x) by defining the
macro TX_POWER_2d5Bm (see the macro definitions at the start of the user_app.c file).
 	
- Devices naming:
    - DA1453x is refering to DA14531-00, DA14531-01, DA14530 and DA14535.
    - DA1458x is refering to DA14585 and DA14586.
    - The DA14531-00 is the main DA14531 device. The -00 is just a new naming to introduce the variant DA14531-01. The DA14531-01 is a ROM variant of the main DA14531-00.
    - The DA14535 is a DA14531 upgrade.
	- The DA14533 is optimized for automotive and industrial applications at higher temperatures, and it is rated as operating up to 105 ºC and compliant with the AEC-Q100 (Grade 2) standard.

- For the DA14533 getting started guide you can refer to this [R19US0026EE0100](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/da14533_getting_started_guide/index.html)
	
## Software Configuration
- Download the [SDK6 latest version](https://www.renesas.com/sdk6_latest)
- Install SEGGER’s J-Link tools.
- If using e² studio with LLVM instead of Keil, ensure your project settings are adjusted accordingly (instructions below).


## Using e² studio with LLVM
Setup for e² studio

#. Switching to e² studio: Instead of using Keil, you can use e² studio with LLVM as the compiler toolchain. Make sure your project is configured for LLVM by selecting the appropriate toolchain in e² studio.

#. Compile and Build: Open your project in e² studio and compile using LLVM. Ensure your environment variables and paths are properly set for the Renesas toolchain.

#. Run and Debug: Connect your device, set the proper debug configuration in e² studio, and start debugging using J-Link.


By switching to e² studio and LLVM, you can take advantage of advanced debugging tools and an open-source toolchain, while maintaining full compatibility with Renesas DA145xx devices.

For detailed steps on using e² studio, refer to the Renesas e² studio User Guide available on the [Renesas website](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/e2_studio_sdk6_getting_started/index.html).
## How to run the example

For the initial setup of the project that involves linking the SDK to this SW example, please follow the Readme [here](../../Readme.md).

### Initial Setup

1.  Build and download the example using the Keil IDE. 
2.  Run the example using the Keil debugger.
3.  Use a Smart Device running an App such as Locate to view the beacons transmitted by the device.


## Note
This example can be built by e2studio and LLVM compiler instead of using Keil.
