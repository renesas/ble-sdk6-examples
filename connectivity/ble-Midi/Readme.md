# ble-Midi

## Example description

This example shows:

- Create MIDI service on BLE peripheral side as [BLE-MIDI specification](https://midi.org/specs) required.
- Demonstrate playing note on an iOS APP that supports MIDI profile, by pressing the buttons on the DA14531-00FXDEVKT-P Development kit.

- Devices naming:
    - DA1453x is refering to DA14531-00, DA14531-01, DA14530, DA14533 and DA14535.
    - DA1458x is refering to DA14585 and DA14586.
    - The DA14531-00 is the main DA14531 device. The -00 is just a new naming to introduce the variant DA14531-01. The DA14531-01 is a ROM variant of the main DA14531-00.
    - The DA14535 is a DA14531 upgrade.
    - The DA14533 is optimized for automotive and industrial applications at higher temperatures, and it is rated as operating up to 105 ºC and compliant with the AEC-Q100 (Grade 2) standard.
