# DA1453x Optimised Ibeacon example

## Example description

The example demonstrates an optimized software implementation for ibeacon on the DA1453x.

- Devices naming:
    - DA1453x is refering to DA14531-00, DA14531-01, DA14530 and DA14535.
    - The DA14531-00 is the main DA14531 device. The -00 is just a new naming to introduce the variant DA14531-01. The DA14531-01 is a ROM variant of the main DA14531-00.
    - The DA14535 is a DA14531 upgrade.
	- The DA14533 is optimized for automotive and industrial applications at higher temperatures, and it is rated as operating up to 105 ºC and compliant with the AEC-Q100 (Grade 2) standard.

The example is an update of the ibeacon SW example: ``BLE_SDK6_examples\connectivity\ibeacon``, below the main modifications, basically we demonstrate how to:

- Alternate Static random address: change the device address in every advertising event
- Alternate Tx output power level: change the Tx output power level in every advertising event
- Alternate User advertising data: change the Beacon advertising payload in every advertising event 

A new ibeacon structure has been created to allow the alternating and the advertising interval is set to 1 s.

Because the example needs changes into the SDK we are providing within the patch directory the patch file: ``patch\SDK6patch.diff``

```` C
/* Set the advertising rate */
#define ADV_INTERVAL_ms							1000
````

```` C
ibeacon_adv_payload_t adv_payload;
ibeacon_adv_payload_t_new adv_payload_new;
````


```` C
if(change_bd_addr_flag % 2)

{
	user_app_adv_start();

	/* Alternate User advertising data*/
	memcpy(store_adv_data, &adv_payload, sizeof(ibeacon_adv_payload_t));
	store_adv_data_len = sizeof(ibeacon_adv_payload_t);

	/* Alternate Tx output power, Set output power to maximum value (0dBm) */
	rf_pa_pwr_set(RF_TX_PWR_LVL_0d0);

	/* Alternate Static random address */
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[0] = 0x11;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[1] = 0x12;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[2] = 0x13;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[3] = 0x14;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[4] = 0x15;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[5] = 0x16;

}
else 

{
	user_app_adv_start_new();

	/* Alternate User advertising data*/
	memcpy(store_adv_data, &adv_payload_new, sizeof(ibeacon_adv_payload_t_new));
	store_adv_data_len = sizeof(ibeacon_adv_payload_t_new);

	/* Alternate Tx output power, Set output power to maximum value (+2.5dBm) */
	rf_pa_pwr_set(RF_TX_PWR_LVL_PLUS_2d5);

	/* Alternate Static random address */
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[0] = 0x01;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[1] = 0x02;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[2] = 0x03;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[3] = 0x04;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[4] = 0x05;
	llm_le_env.rand_add.addr[5] = 0x06;
}

In this example we are showing also how to tune the DA14531 for a minimum current consumption.
When the changes are applied to the SDK, the current consumption will be decreased by 18%. 

**Below the list of changes for power improvement:**

- Optimize  the time between Tx pulses

````
rwble.c :

__BLEIRQ void rwble_isr(void)
{
.....
   /* Optimize  the time between Tx pulses */
	ble_advtim_set (500);
}

````

![Optimize  the time between Tx pulses](assets/interchannel.jpg)



- Lower the clock speed on the AMBA when sleep preparation 

````
arch_system.c :

__WEAK bool app_use_lower_clocks_check(void)
{
	 return true;
}
````
![Lower the clock speed on the AMBA](assets/power_clock.jpg)

- Remove RCX read and calibration

````
arch_main.c :

#if defined (__DA14531__)
       // rcx20_read_freq(false);
#endif

````

- Reduce RF calibration routine 

````
arch_system.c :

void conditionally_run_radio_cals(void)
{
#if defined (__DA14531__)
#if (USE_RF_LDO_CALIBRATION)
    if (((current_time - last_time) >= 500000) || rf_ldo_calibration_pending)
 

````
- Reduce XTAL32M wait time 

````
otp_cs.c :

#define XTAL32M_WAIT_TRIM_TIME_USEC      (500)  // 500 usec
 
````

- Optimize xtal start-up time

````
arch.h :

#if defined (__DA14531__)
#define HW_STARTUP_TIME_IN_XTAL32K_CYCLES    (5)   // 5 LP clocks for startup state machine handling
#define HW_STARTUP_TIME_IN_RCX_CYCLES        (3)    // 3 LP clocks for startup state machine handling
#define RCX_BLE_PWR_UP_TO_SLP_IRQ_USEC       (30)
#define XTAL32K_BLE_PWR_UP_TO_SLP_IRQ_USEC   (30)
#endif
 
````

The results are given in the below screenshots:

- Average power consumption  with no software optimization : **2,77 uA**

![Average power consumption  : No SW optimisation](assets/results_no_optim.jpg)


- Average power consumption  with software optimization : **2,27 uA**

![Average power consumption : With SW optimization](assets/results_optim.jpg)

- Average power consumption during sleep : **1,2 uA**

**Estimate battery life**

Battery life can be calculated when you know the average current consumption of the device and the energy capacity of your battery.
Battery Lifetime Estimator tool can be used and it can be loaded (from the Smartsnippets toolbox) by selecting the “Power Monitor” under Layout in the Toolbar or the “Battery Lifetime Estimator” under Tools.

## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

- This example runs on the DA1453x (DA14531-00, DA14531-01 and DA14535) Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
- The user manuals for the development kits can be found [Here](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/wireless-connectivity/bluetooth-low-energy/da14531-00fxdevkt-p-smartbond-tiny-da14531-bluetooth-low-energy-51-system-chip-development-kit-pro) for the DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard.

- For the DA14535 getting started guide you can refer to this [UM-B-165](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/DA14535/UM-B-165-DA14531-Getting-Started-With-The-Pro-Development-Kit/index.html#device-family-getting-started-with-the-pro-development-kits)
- For the DA14533 getting started guide you can refer to this [R19US0026EE0100](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/da14533_getting_started_guide/index.html)

## Software Configuration
- Download the latest version of [SDK6 latest version](https://www.renesas.com/sdk6_latest).
- Install SEGGER’s J-Link tools.

If using e² studio with LLVM instead of Keil, ensure your project settings are adjusted accordingly (instructions below).


## Using e² studio with LLVM
Setup for e² studio

#. Switching to e² studio: Instead of using Keil, you can use e² studio with LLVM as the compiler toolchain. Make sure your project is configured for LLVM by selecting the appropriate toolchain in e² studio.


#. Compile and Build: Open your project in e² studio and compile using LLVM. Ensure your environment variables and paths are properly set for the Renesas toolchain.

#. Run and Debug: Connect your device, set the proper debug configuration in e² studio, and start debugging using J-Link.


By switching to e² studio and LLVM, you can take advantage of advanced debugging tools and an open-source toolchain, while maintaining full compatibility with Renesas DA145xx devices.

For detailed steps on using e² studio, refer to the Renesas e² studio User Guide available on the [Renesas website](https://lpccs-docs.renesas.com/e2_studio_sdk6_getting_started/index.html).

## How to run the example

For the initial setup of the project that involves linking the SDK to this SW example, please follow the Readme [here](../../Readme.md).

### Initial Setup

1.  Build and download the example using the Keil IDE. 
2.  Run the example using the Keil debugger.
3.  Use a Smart Device running an App such as Locate to view the beacons transmitted by the DA14531.


## Note
This example can be built by e2studio and LLVM compiler instead of using Keil.
